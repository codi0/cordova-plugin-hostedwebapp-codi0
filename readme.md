# Hosted Web Application
This plugin enables the creation of a hosted web application from a [W3C manifest](http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/manifest/) that provides metadata associated with a web site. It uses properties in the manifest to update corresponding properties in the Cordova configuration file to enable using content hosted in the site inside a Cordova application.
